27 June 2009: Release 6
-----------------------
After a few undocumented releases, a new major release from
scratch. This includes an improved autotools based build system (with
even faster parallel build), GIT as a SCM, glib replacing popt for
command line parsing, and a few more changes under the hood to improve
quality.

21 July 2006: Release 5.3.2
-------------------------
Implementation of --traytoggle option, as for latest eject releases. Fix for
running on PowerPC and other platforms where chars are unsigned. Fix a few
bashisms in the configure script, and make gsed now optional. Add XHTML
documentation of unieject(1) and unieject.conf(5). Build system reorganisation
to build faster with parallel make.

24 June 2006: Release 5.3.1
---------------------------
Simple enhancement version, that improves NLS support once again, by removing
the faulty Brazilian translation, and adding a working Portugues translation,
and a Spanish translation. It fixes the segmentation fault entirely, and finally
fixes the segmentation fault. Also, this version ignores --scsi/-s parameters
to be more compatible with classic eject command.

16 June 2006: Release 5.3
-------------------------
This version adds improved NLS support, with more translations: Dutch, German,
Brazilian Portuguese, Argentine Spanish. It also fixes a segmentation fault, and
make ejection of USB flash drives work out of the box (before it asked a bit of
toying around).

05 June 2006: Release 5.2
-------------------------
Fix ejection failure on almost all cases, added support for translations and add
Italian translation. Let the return code of the umount wrapper to fall ignored
as it might return error when it's not mounted at all.

30 December 2005: Release 5.1
-----------------------------
First service release, mainly replace the old man pages with new ones written in
DocBook (thanks to Stuart Herbert from Gentoo), but also fixes the autotools
support to make it saner, and add extern "C" for functions in libunieject.

26 September 2005: Release 5
----------------------------
This release is the first one with the public SVN, but still nobody stepped up
to prepare translations. It features a documentation cleanup, the new manpages
that uses mxml2man (and are no more created at buildtime, so no more extra
deps), and a clean up in dependencies, now also libconfuse is optional (but
required to get the configuration file working). It also adds a new lock action
to lock/unlock the manual eject of a CD-Rom drive.

30 August 2005: Release 4
-------------------------
Another release, this time with working gettext support. Also added "loadcd"
alias to trayclose. Now the release are built with make dist, and it also
generate the ChangeLog using svn2cl xsl file (require xsltproc and access
to my SVN repository, so I'm the only one who can use it right now). Added
preliminary support to Doxygen. Now unieject builds fine without any kind of
warning.

31 July 2005: Release 3
-----------------------
New major release. Added gettext (internationalization) support. Added support
for a configuration file with default parameters to unieject command.
Added support for configurable umount wrappers like pumount and hmount.
There's a test manpage for libunieject_setspeed(3) function.
This version requires libconfuse and builds only with GCC and ICC (with support
for __attribute__((constructor)).

24 July 2005: Release 2.1
-------------------------
Quick release to change the default access method to Linux CD-Roms from ioctl
to READ_CD, as ioctl seems to be broken on SCSI mediums.
Also improved the man page with information about the environmental variables
affecting the execution.
Added a parameter to change the access mode for the command and another to set
the debug level for libcdio output (doesn't affect unieject verbosity).

23 July 2005: Release 2
-----------------------
This is the second public "working" version, the first hitting Gentoo's Portage.
Respect to the first release it features a complete manpage for the unieject
tool, a "wannabe stable" API interface, and a complete FreeBSD support for both
direct ATAPI mode and CAM mode.

Mac OSX support is still pre-alpha, and needs quite a few changes as for the
moment it doesn't seems to be able to open the device (libcdio problems?).
