23 June 2005: Release 2
-----------------------
This is the second public "working" version, the first hitting Gentoo's Portage.
Respect to the first release it features a complete manpage for the unieject
tool, a "wannabe stable" API interface, and a complete FreeBSD support for both
direct ATAPI mode and CAM mode.

Mac OSX support is still pre-alpha, and needs quite a few changes as for the
moment it doesn't seems to be able to open the device (libcdio problems?).
