26 September 2005: Release 5
----------------------------
This release is the first one with the public SVN, but still nobody stepped up
to prepare translations. It features a documentation cleanup, the new manpages
that uses mxml2man (and are no more created at buildtime, so no more extra
deps), and a clean up in dependencies, now also libconfuse is optional (but
required to get the configuration file working). It also adds a new lock action
to lock/unlock the manual eject of a CD-Rom drive.

30 August 2005: Release 4
-------------------------
Another release, this time with working gettext support. Also added "loadcd"
alias to trayclose. Now the release are built with make dist, and it also
generate the ChangeLog using svn2cl xsl file (require xsltproc and access
to my SVN repository, so I'm the only one who can use it right now). Added
preliminary support to Doxygen. Now unieject builds fine without any kind of
warning.

31 July 2005: Release 3
-----------------------
New major release. Added gettext (internationalization) support. Added support
for a configuration file with default parameters to unieject command.
Added support for configurable umount wrappers like pumount and hmount.
There's a test manpage for libunieject_setspeed(3) function.
This version requires libconfuse and builds only with GCC and ICC (with support
for __attribute__((constructor)).

24 July 2005: Release 2.1
-------------------------
Quick release to change the default access method to Linux CD-Roms from ioctl
to READ_CD, as ioctl seems to be broken on SCSI mediums.
Also improved the man page with information about the environmental variables
affecting the execution.
Added a parameter to change the access mode for the command and another to set
the debug level for libcdio output (doesn't affect unieject verbosity).

23 July 2005: Release 2
-----------------------
This is the second public "working" version, the first hitting Gentoo's Portage.
Respect to the first release it features a complete manpage for the unieject
tool, a "wannabe stable" API interface, and a complete FreeBSD support for both
direct ATAPI mode and CAM mode.

Mac OSX support is still pre-alpha, and needs quite a few changes as for the
moment it doesn't seems to be able to open the device (libcdio problems?).
