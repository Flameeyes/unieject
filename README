unieject: Universal Eject command
---------------------------------

This package consists of a library and a command line tool which uses that lib.

libunieject is a library which allows the linked software to perform
automatical ejects and unmounting the filesystems for the device you want to
eject.
At the time of writing (pre-1 release), this is still not API-stable nor well
documented, but this is going to improve in next versions.

The command line tool instead is a mimic of classic eject command for Linux
( http://eject.sourceforge.net/ ), which supports also the features of
FreeBSD's eject command ( http://www.freshports.org/sysutils/eject/ ).

It hasn't a complete syntax compatibility with either Linux's or FreeBSD's
ejects as they have conflicts between them, but the main options are the
same.

It can fully replace FreeBSD's eject (in both atapi and atapicam mode), and
already mime the main options of Linux's eject.

To be compiled and executed it requires libcdio (tested with 0.74 and above)
and libpopt. It also requires txt2man ( http://mvertes.free.fr/ ) to compile
the manpages.
For FreeBSD support you'll also need an extra patch for libcdio-0.75 to be
able to manage ATAPI cdroms (/dev/acd*).
